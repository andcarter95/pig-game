# Pig Game

## Description

Rules: This is a two player game where a player hits the roll dice button and the score
is added to the current section. If you roll a six the current score is zero'd out
and it becomes the next players turn. When you click hold, the hold score is added to 
the players total score and it becomes the next players turn. First player to 100 wins.

This project was built during Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript Udemy course. He wrote
the css and html and I wrote the javascript to give the game functionality and logic.
